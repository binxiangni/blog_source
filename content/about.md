This is a personal website of Binxiang Ni. I am currently a master student in statistics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Open to new information and knowledge, I believe I am a quick learner to this fast world of vast data. Starting from RcppArmadillo, I am still a newbie to open source community but hope to contribute more.
